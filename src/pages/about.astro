		<h1>Aussies to play two T20 warm-ups in T&T</h1>

TRINIDAD and Tobago will host eight matches in the warm-up phase of the 2024 ICC World Cup next month and among those fixtures will be a clash between West Indies and Australia on May 30 at the Queen's Park Oval in St Clair.

The Aussies will play two matches at the Oval, the other match being against Namibia on May 28, while the Windies will play just one warm-up game.

While the hosts will have just one warm-up fixture, they will face South Africa in three T20Is in Jamaica from May 23 to 26 prior to their arrival in T& T.

Eight warm-up matches are scheduled to be played in Trinidad, with the World Cup venue the Brian Lara Cricket Academy hosting four and warm-up/practice venue Queen's Park Oval hosting four.

The warm-up period runs from May 27 to June 1.

The tournament takes place from June 1-29 in the Caribbean and the United States.

The official warm-up match fixtures were announced yesterday.

Eight matches are also scheduled to be played in the US, split between the Grand Prairie Cricket Stadium, and the Broward County Stadium.

Warm-up fixtures will be 20 overs per side and will not carry international T20 status, as teams will be allowed to field all members of their 15-player squad.

And in a change from the previous rights cycle, teams will now have the option of playing up to two warm-up matches depending on arrival time at the event.

The West Indies against Australia fixture at the Oval will be open to fans and tickets will be available at tickets.t20worldcup.com or box offices located at the National Cricket Centre and Queen's Park Oval and went on sale yesterday.

		<h3>Ahye 3rd in Italy</h3>

â–  SAVONA

JAMAICAN sprint hurdlers, Omar McLeod and Brittany Anderson logged solid wins at the 13th Savona International meet Wednesday in Italy.

Trinidad and Tobago flat sprinter Michelle-Lee Ahye also ran impressively to grab a podium finish at the meet, which took place at Centro Sportivo Fontanassa in the city of Savona.

McLeod, the 2016 Rio Olympics Men's 110 metres hurdles champion, opened his season with a time of 13.37 seconds to finish narrowly ahead of Joshua Zeller of Great Britain, with a time of 13.42 secs, and Enrique Llopis of Spain, with a time of 13.43.

It was the first competitive race in the discipline since April last year at the LSU Invitational in the United States, and he will be looking to build on this start with the Jamaica national championships about six weeks away.

Anderson, 23, a World Championship silver medallist in the Women's 100m hurdles two years ago, continued her strong early form with a season- best time of 12.88.

She too, cut it close, finishing only four hundredths-of-a-second ahead of Zarah Lavin of Ireland, with hometown girl Eliza Maria Di Lazzaro finishing in 12.99 to cop third.

Ahye, 32, the 2018 Commonwealth Games women's 100 champion, ran nowhere near her personal best and clocked 11.16 to settle for third in the dash behind hometown girl Zaynab Dosso, whose winning time was 11.02, and Patrizia Van Der Weken of Luxembourg with a time of 11.12.
