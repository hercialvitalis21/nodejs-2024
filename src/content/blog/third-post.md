Republic Bank Ltd (Trust and Asset Management Division) on Thursday declared that Portland (Barbados) Ltd, a company controlled by Jamaican entrepreneur Michael Lee-Chin, "has defaulted on its obligations under the supplemental trust deed to pay to noteholders the final bullet payment" of US$23 million on April 30, 2024.

Republic Bank also said the failure by Portland (Barbados) to make the final bullet payment within seven business days from April 30, "constituted an event of default (as defined in the trust deed) and noteholders and/or trustees are entitled, under the trust deed, to take such enforcement actions as are permitted under the trust deed."

The seven business days is the grace period allowed in the trust deed between the parties. The grace period ended on May 9.

The note was issued on April 28, 2022, for two-year term and paid an interest rate of 8.25 per cent.

The declarations by Republic Bank, serving as the trustee for the note, came in a three-page agreement to noteholders, dated May 9. The letter was signed by Lee-Chin as director of Portland Barbados and Jennifer Dearsley as authorised signatory.

The current collateral for the US$23 million note is US$4 million in cash, as well as shares in Jamaica's NCB Financial Group (NCBFG), which were pledged with the official stock exchanges of Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago. Those shares would have been pledged by Lee-Chin, who is listed as the majority shareholder of NCBFG, as at March 31, 2024 in the company's May 9 half-year report, with a total of 1,445,299,340 shares.

On April 28, 2022, around the time the NCBFG shares were pledged, the financial holding company traded at J$111. Yesterday, NCBFG closed at J$63.70 on the Jamaica Stock Exchange, which is a decline of 42.6 per cent since the note was issued.

In the agreement, Portland Barbados also stated, "The company (meaning Portland) by signing this agreement acknowledges and agrees that as of May 9, 2024, an event of default has occured and the noteholders are entitled to exercise their enforcement and other rights under the trust."

Portland Barbados also acknowledged and agreed that by signing the agreement, it entered into a repayment plan that was agreed to by a majority of the noteholders on May 9.

The basis of the repayment plan is that the noteholders should receive payments in May, June and August.

According to the letter, Portland Barbados agreed to the following:

i) "The company (meaning Portland Barbados) to pay to the trustee the sum of US$4 million together with interest due and paybale as at April 30, 2024 on/before May 29, 2024;

ii) "The company to pay to the trustee the sum of US$4 million on/before June 15, 2024;

iii) The company to pay to the trustee the sum of US$8 million together with interest, as set out below...due and payable as at August 15, 2024 on/before August 15, 2024;

iv) "The company will pay to the trustee as part of the August payment, interest calculated at 10.25 per cent per annum, being the interest rate specified in the supplemental trust deed (8.25 per cent), plus the default rate (of 2 per cent). However, should the company default in any of its payment obligations as specified in this agreement, the company will pay noteholders interest at a rate of 12.25 per cent per annum, being the default rate (2 per cent), plus the current rate payable of 10.25 per cent."

That means Portland Barbados agreed to pay the trustee US$16 million plus interest between May 29 and August 15, 2024. The agreement continued:

v) The company (Portland Barbados) has no objection to the trustee making the following distributions between May 20, 2024 and August 15, 2024 to noteholders:

a) Distribution to the noteholders on a pro-rata basis on/before May 29 of the current cash collateral of US$4 million;

b) Distribution to noteholders on a pro-rata basis on/after May 29, 2024, of US$4 million plus interest from the May payment;

c) Distribution to noteholders on a pro-rata basis on/after June 15, 2024, of US$4 million from the June payment; and

d) Final distribution to noteholders of the remaining principal (US$8 million) and interest on/after August 15, 2024 from the August payment.

As outlined in the distribution schedule, the noteholders are due to received a total of US$20 million between May 29 and August 15. The agreement does not explain why the noteholders are due to receive US$20 million and not the US$23 million face value of the note.

Guardian Media sent a message to Lee-Chin early last Friday afternoon, informing him that it had sight of the Republic Bank agreement, quoting key elements of it and asking him to comment. He responded that afternoon to say, "I just spoke to the trustees and they said categorically that an event of default has not occurred."

Later last Friday, Lee-Chin was sent a copy of the agreement by WhatsApp and was asked to confirm whether the signature at the end of the three-page letter was his. He did not respond immediately.

On Sunday morning, Guardian Media wrote to him again, asking him to confirm that the signature was his. He requested time to be allowed to talk with the trustee, in order to discuss sending an official statement to the newspaper on the issue. Up to last night, no statement had been received.

MP Charles

Naparima MP Rodney Charles makes his way to the Red House to attend the sitting of Parliament on April 19.

KERWIN PIERRE

Estranged UNC MP Rodney Charles has accused UNC leader Kamla Persad-Bissessar of not being present in Parliament to vote on at least 20 crucial bills over the term.

He said he has been the one who has taken on Prime Minister Keith Rowley “mano a mano” in Parliament with questions.

Charles did so via a statement yesterday after Persad-Bissessar accused him and MPs Rushton Paray, Rai Ragbir, Dinesh Rambally, and Anita Haynes-Alleyne of “running away” from Parliament and “breaking biche” for last Friday’s vote on a Government motion. 

It was passed by 19 PNM votes, but UNC’s 19-member bench was reduced to 14 due to the absence of the five MPs. 

Persad-Bissessar said that in a deadlock, the House Speaker’s vote goes towards maintaining the status quo, and the UNC would have defeated the Government’s motion if all MPs were present and there was a 19-19 deadlock. 

Yesterday, Charles, citing his performance, said that between 2020 and 2024, he spoke on 44 bills and motions and missed only seven Parliament sittings. He claimed that between 2020 and 2024, he asked 49 questions to the Prime Minister in Parliament, but during the same period, Persad-Bissessar asked only one.

“On many occasions during the Prime Minister’s questions, she wasn’t even present to provide moral support as we faced the full wrath of the raging bull,” he claimed. “It was MP Charles, not the Opposition Leader, who took on Dr Keith Christopher Rowley ‘mano a mano’ in Parliament.”

He detailed nine bills and issues between 2020 and 2024 when he was present and voted. 

“So for the leader to make exaggerated statements about my record in Parliament is careless, irresponsible, and ill-advised. In 2023, I issued 68 releases to the media and spoke at 13 weekly news conferences. I defy anyone to question my commitment to holding the Rowley Government to account.”

Charles said that “despite begging too many times to recall”, he had only been placed by UNC on the Foreign and Caricom Affairs Parliamentary Committee, despite 28 years of expertise at academic and senior energy sector management levels. 

Not told by the whip of a government motion on last Friday’s sitting, Charles claimed Persad-Bissessar and MPs Davendranath Tancoo and Saddam Hosein came prepared to debate the Government’s motion.

“Who advised them to prepare, is best answered by Chief Whip David Lee. Also, the Supplemental Order paper was sent to MPs 24 hours before, as required by the Standing Orders,” Charles said. 

“What we now realise is that the whip deliberately didn’t advise about anything concerning the motion, even though I was in the caucus room at least 30 minutes before Parliament convened. 

“Mr Lee only advised that he had oral questions on the order paper. Normal practice is for a whip to advise MPs on motions to be discussed, the line-up of speakers, and, infrequently, the party’s positions,” Charles said. 

The whip sets the tone and indicates the importance attached to bills being debated. 

“But what occurred last Friday demonstrated a very disturbing trend of keeping certain MPs in the dark and deselecting them from speaking on important bills. Interestingly, the UNC, not the PNM, called for a vote (count) at the end of the Government’s motion, clearly to embarrass certain UNC members. Why?”

The new modus operandi in the UNC, disturbingly, is to train guns not on the PNM, who are allowed to get away with murder, but UNC members who dare ask questions.” 

Charles added, “It pains my heart to see my leader attempting to tarnish the efforts of her ‘children’ in the party, forcing us to defend our integrity and character. I call on the leader to eschew the old politics of division, bacchanal and one-upmanship and be an agent of reconciliation, maturity, integrity, and servant leadership.”

Charles said, “Fight me on those principles—not on antediluvian political commess, manufactured victimhood, ostracism, and the usual boring distractions of a bygone era,” repeating calls for generational transfer of leadership in T&T’s politics and the announcement of UNC’s Natex election date.

'Don’t try that'
 

UNC leader Kamla Persad-Bissessar and UNC whip David Lee issued statements on Monday about last Friday’s absence of MP Rodney Charles and the other four MPs. They did not reply to Charles’ statement yesterday. 

But MPs Davendranath Tancoo and Saddam Hosein did. 

Hosein said, “I take my duty as a parliamentarian very seriously. We had notice of the Government’s motion since Wednesday, 24 April. Every parliamentarian knows to always be prepared for matters listed on the order paper ... So I take it as a compliment Mr Charles has acknowledged that I’m always prepared and willing to debate. This is evident from the 128 debates I’ve participated in collectively as a senator and MP. The only question is why wasn’t Mr Charles present at 6 pm in Parliament last Friday because the debate on the Government’s motion commenced instantaneously after 6 pm.” 

Tancoo said, “I came prepared to speak because I saw the order paper and the supplemental order paper, which were shared with all MPs by Parliament’s staff and which stated what the Government’s intention was to debate ... It’s my duty and the duty of every elected representative to be present and prepared to debate and vote on any and every bill/motion on the order paper.

“The political leader’s issue was about attendance on that day and the effect it could have had on the vote. But I note Mr Charles went off on his own expedition about everything—except that.”
