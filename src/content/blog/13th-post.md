ATTORNEY GENERAL Reginald Armour has disclosed that a building is being sourced for the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) and efforts are being made to provide more staff.

As he wound up the debate on The Administration of Justice (Indictable Proceedings) (Amendment) (AJIPA) Bill 2024 at the Senate sitting yesterday, Armour shut down arguments by Opposition Senator Jayanti Lutchmedial with respect to resources at the DPP's office.

He said the DPP had declined a move by the AG's office to source staff from the Commonwealth to fill vacancies.

The AG said that last year he wrote to the Commonwealth Secretary General, Baroness Patricia Scotland, about filling the vacancies at the DPP's office in Trinidad with staff from the region.

'I got her agreement to engage with me and I engaged with the DPP to bring Commonwealth lawyers to Trinidad to staff the DPP. The DPP said 'no, thank you'. We are now in the process of filling vacancies on short-term contracts. The Judicial and Legal Service is in the process of doing that, as we speak vacancies are being filled,' he said.

'As we speak there is a building that is being sourced so that the DPP will have a building to move into and to give him the spatial requirements that he needs and at his request we are currently moving provisions for IT facilities for the DPP,' he added.

In response to questions from the Express with respect to his refusal of Commonwealth staff and a new building, DPP Roger Gaspard issued a brief reply yesterday saying, 'Not surprised that the AG didn't contextualise my 'refusal'. Maybe he forgot. 'News' of a new building is just that.'

Park Street fiasco

In October 2023, the AG confirmed that the Government had ended the lease for a building for the DPP's office on Park Street, Port of Spain, that was never occupied and after $55 million was spent. The DPP 'refused to move in', he said.

'At the end of September 2023, the Government terminated that lease after having spent a total-in rent, electricity bills and renovations to introduce bullet-proofing along the entire north-eastern wall of the property at the request of the DPP-of $55,551.443.93. The lease on that building has been terminated because the DPP has refused to move into the building,' Armour said then.

He shared this at the Standing Finance Committee meeting where Opposition MP Saddam Hosein had asked for an update on the 'relocation' of the office of the DPP to the new building.

Armour said the Government had terminated the lease of the North Park Street Building, which the DPP had agreed in 2014 to move into.

He said the term of the lease had expired and it was running on a month-to-month basis and was terminated 'and we moved out at the end of September'.

Asked by Hosein whether there were any plans for a new building, the Attorney General said consideration was being given to temporary accommodation for some of the DPP's staff who are going to be allocated by the JLSC. He said the DPP will remain in the Winsure Building and additional staff, hopefully, will be relocated. They are considering a site on which a proper building can be built out for a number of legal staff, and 'Hopefully the DPP (if that is actualised) will agree to move there'.

Earlier last year, controversy erupted after the DPP said in a radio interview that if his office does not receive additional staff soon, it could lead to an inevitable collapse of the criminal justice system.

He stressed the shortfall of his office in prosecuting matters, and called for the appointment of additional attorneys to his office.

For the DPP's Office to effectively operate, Gaspard said there was need for approximately 129 attorneys, but there are only 58 prosecutors.

He said, 'I would describe that problem as acute and chronic. It is very critical where any time you reach a stage where the number of courts outnumber the number prosecutors, that must be an area of concern.'

Speedier justice

Also in the Senate yesterday, Armour said he does not accept the criticisms that there are insufficient resources and insufficient will on the part of the Government to work with all stakeholders to enable the administration of justice moving forward.

He also addressed a submission from Lutchmedial that there is still a preference for the system that existed in preliminary enquiries where the evidence needed to be tested.

'The short point in answer to that is that the evidence of a fair trial is going to be tested,' he said.

Armour explained that, under AJIPA, someone is charged and documentation is brought before the master with the evidence. There is not going to be any cross-examination, he said. 'You have to trust your judges to apply the law, to be dispassionate, to be fair,' said Armour.

He said the master is going to look at that documentary evidence and decide whether or not a prima facie case has been made out.

'Prima facie meaning whether there is sufficient credible evidence that persuades the master that on the offence charged this person should face a trial at the assizes,' he said.

Armour said under the old system some six to ten years was spent cross-examining the witnesses before the magistrate could commit to the assizes and the entire system got clogged with the victims, accused, families and community suffering.

He said when the master takes a decision there is trial and the process moves along faster.

There is no compromise of the fair trial, he said, adding that the accused is going to know his fate in a shorter period of time.
