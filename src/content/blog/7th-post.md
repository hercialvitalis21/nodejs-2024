President Maduro warned that U.S. is preparing Venezuela-Guyana conflict
The President of the Republic, Nicolás Maduro warned this Monday during his 43rd program “Con Maduro +” that the government of the United States (US) has prepared a Venezuela-Guyana conflict.

In this regard, he referred that the US has planned a set of conflicts of a military nature, of a violent nature. “What is the United States doing here in Guyana? Why have they established 12 secret bases of the CIA? Why have they established 14 secret bases of the Southern Command in Guyana, our territory? Because they are also looking for a conflict here”, he denounced.

From the Miraflores Palace, the Head of State denounced that the US plan, in view of the loss of influence in Asia, Eurasia and Africa, is to take refuge and recolonize our America.

The President commented on an opinion article published by the Washington Post, which states that “the US is staggering towards a decline from which few powers have recovered”. He referred that in the face of the decline of the US empire in the construction of the new world the US economy functions as a war economy and pointed out that the 21 states of the 50 states of the United States live off war dollars.

“It is planned in this period of decline to wage war and try by way of violence and military to maintain its dominance, its hegemony and its influence,” he said.

Venezuelan National Assembly Approves Pension Protection Bill

The National Assembly of Venezuela approved on Thursday in the first discussion, the Social Security Pension Protection Bill, after it was presented to that body by the executive vice president of Venezuela, Delcy Rodriguez.

“We wanted to bring this bill that has 13 articles that seek special protection, through contributions and contributions of private business for the protection of pensions against criminal blockade” said Rodríguez and also recalled that the country’s income from the blockade was impacted by 99 percent.

In that sense, she denounced that on April 18, the United States Government reimposed sanctions against Venezuela and its oil industry, which will generate losses in revenues that reach and exceed 2,000,000,000 by 2024.

“The determination of the Venezuelan people has been very firm in saying that no criminal blockade, no blackmail and no extortion can change the will and sovereignty of the Venezuelan people” she said, while stressing that the only will that should govern the country is that of the people and not that of any foreign mandate.

The Bill for the Protection of Social Security Pensions against the Imperialist Blockade is approved, in its first discussion.

Rodriguez demanded that the lifting of sanctions against Venezuela is a right of Venezuelans and insisted that the Law on the Protection of Social Security Pensions is not only social protection.

Far-Right is Linked to PDVSA-Crypto Case

On Monday, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro condemned the involvement of the extreme right in the PDVSA-CRYPTO case, which involves the use of cryptocurrencies for the corrupt appropriation of resources from the company Petroleum of Venezuela (PDVSA)

During his program “With Maduro +,” he stated that the investigation has yielded compelling evidence for the full force of the law to come down on the corrupt individuals.

“A highly corrupt mafia was formed. It took advantage of the trust and power given to them not only to embezzle the country but also to align with an extremist right-wing plan and with the United States government,” Maduro said.

He also emphasized that Attorney General Tarek William Saab has managed to gather evidence through conversations, Zoom video conferences, and statements from those involved.

According to the evidence obtained, since January 2018, elements of the Venezuelan far-right such as Leopoldo Lopez were coordinating conspiracies with the White House to assassinate the Venezuelan president and carry out a coup.

    <p><p>■ Anna Ramdass</p>

<p>STOP the probe. Auditor General Jaiwantie Ramdass has initiated legal action to stop the investigation into her office and the Finance Ministry, saying it is unconstitutional and an attempt by Finance Minister Colm Imbert to distance himself from the fiasco he created.</p>
<p>A pre-action protocol letter was issued yesterday by Freedom Law Chambers headed by former AG Anand Ramlogan to Imbert as well as lead of the investigating committee, retired judge David Harris, and member David Benjamin.</p>
<p>The pre-action letter challenges the appointment of an investigation team to investigate the circumstances surrounding the understatement of revenue in the Auditor General's Report for the financial year 2023 and related matters. A response was requested by May 15 given the 'urgency and fundamental public and constitutional importance of this matter', failing which judicial review will be filed to challenge the appointment of the investigating team, according to the letter.</p>
<p>Previously, the Auditor General had commenced legal action against the Attorney General claiming that her constitutional rights have been breached. She is also seeking protection under the law as well as payment of her legal fees.</p>
<p>The entire imbroglio was sparked after the Finance Ministry submitted the country's national accounts on January 31, 2024 but in April this year submitted amended accounts citing understated revenue by $2.6 billion which they claimed resulted from an electronic cheque clearing system. Public service disrepute</p>
<p>The pre-action letter issued yesterday, signed by attorney Aasha Ramlal, stated that powers to address issues with Auditor General fall under the purview of the Public Service Commission (PSC).</p>
<p>The letter noted that Section 121 of the Constitution vests sole and exclusive jurisdiction for the appointment, promotion, transfer and disciplining of public service officers in the PSC.</p>
<p>Ramlal stated that the understatement of the Government's revenue in the original sum of $3.4 billion (originally) and subsequently, $2.9 billion gives rise to a prima facie case of conduct that is prejudicial to the public service and that will tend to bring the public service into disrepute.</p>
<p>She said that this arguably constitutes misconduct under the PSC Regulations and as such it is a matter that falls within the constitutional jurisdiction and remit of the independent PSC.</p>
<p>'The minister has usurped the constitutional role and function of the independent PSC by purporting to appoint his own investigation team to enquire into the conduct of public officers in the Ministry of Finance,' stated the letter.</p>
<p>The attorney claimed this is a breach of Section 121 of the Constitution and an impermissible intrusion into the constitutional remit of the PSC.</p>
<p>It was noted that public officers in the ministry hold a disciplinary jurisdiction of the PSC which is specifically authorised to conduct such investigations.</p>
<p>The letter added that Public Service Regulations set out the procedure for conduct for disciplinary proceedings and the necessary safeguards to ensure that there is a fair hearing in accordance with the principles of fundamental and natural justice.</p>
<p>'Insofar as the investigation purports to investigate the action and conduct of public officers that fall under the jurisdiction of the PSC it therefore amounts to an illegal and unconstitutional trespass on the jurisdiction of the independent PSC,' stated the letter.</p>
<p>False narrative</p>
<p>The pre-action letter stated that Imbert has usurped the constitutional role and function of the independent PSC by purporting to appoint his own investigation team to enquire into the conduct of public officers in the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>Ramlal stated that this is a breach of section 121 of the Constitution and an impermissible intrusion into the constitutional remit of the PSC.</p>
<p>The letter also noted Imbert's recent explanation about the claim that the amended national accounts submitted to the Auditor General were 'backdated'.</p>
<p>'Having constantly publicly attacked our client over the past two weeks by repeatedly spinning the false narrative that his ministry was not guilty of submitting backdated accounts with the amended higher revenue figure, he has finally admitted that it did in fact 'inadvertently' submit amended accounts with the wrong date,' stated the letter.</p>
<p>The letter added that Imbert deliberately omitted to mention the fact that it was the Auditor General who, by letter dated April 17, 2024, wrote the Attorney General to complain about this backdating of the national accounts because the discrepancy raised serious ethical and legal issues.</p>
<p>It added that the minister further failed to mention that it was the Auditor General who by letter dated April 15, 2024 again highlighted the discrepancy and called upon his ministry to submit the correct version of the accounts with the correct date because she was not prepared to act on the backdated amended accounts that were submitted.</p>
<p>The attorney stated that it was only after these two letters were written by the Auditor General that the Ministry of Finance resubmitted the amended accounts with the correct date of April 16, 2024 instead of the backdated date of January 31, 2024.</p>
<p>Unconstitutional and illegal It added that the problem is complicated by the fact that the terms of reference clearly trespass on the constitutional independence of the Auditor General.</p>
<p>The letter stated that the grounds are so wide that they amount to and/or can cover an investigation into the action and conduct of the Auditor General in relation to the performance of her constitutional and statutory duties.</p>
<p>'This is ultra vires, unconstitutional and illegal because neither the minister nor the Cabinet has constitutional jurisdiction and lawful authority to investigate the action and conduct of the Auditor General outside the narrow confines of section 136 of the Constitution,' stated the pre-action.</p>
<p>It was noted that the investigation team is mandated to report to the minister within two months and Ramdass is expected to drop whatever she is doing and participate in this investigation without the benefit of independent legal advice and representation.</p>
<p>'Given the political ramifications and hypersensitivity of this matter, the minister's attempt to appoint an independent investigation with a team of independent investigators will not withstand legal scrutiny and judicial review,' stated the letter.</p>
<p>Ramlal stated that Imbert has so compromised his position in this matter that there is a real danger and risk of bias on his part such that he is disqualified from appointing independent investigators to investigate this matter. It added that in the zeal to investigate the Auditor General, the Terms of Reference have clearly breached Ramdass' constitutional independence.</p>
<p>The attorney stated that the investigation is neither sanctioned nor authorised by the Constitution.</p>
<p>Ramdass can only be investigated for misconduct and/ or removed from Office in accordance with the clear provisions of the Constitution which are set out at Section 136 of the Constitution, the letter said.</p>
<p>The letter added that the Terms of Reference are ultra vires, unconstitutional and illegal because the constitutional power to investigate under section 36 prohibits an investigation by the Minister of Finance which bypasses and/ or trespasses into and/or overlaps with the exclusive powers conferred by the Constitution.

'Saboteur' nabbed</p>
<p>Imbert: Suspect held at Finance Ministry</p>
<p>AN individual was caught and charged with trying to sabotage the Finance Ministry's water system which could have led to the damage and destruction of important documents, says acting Prime Minister Colm Imbert.</p>
<p>Imbert, who is the Finance Minister, yesterday issued media a release stating that the incident occurred on April 30.</p>
<p>He said the individual had gained unauthorised access to the top floor of the Ministry of Finance head office building at the Eric Williams Financial Complex by pretending to be a member of an exterior building cleaning team.</p>
<p>Imbert said that suspicion arose later in the day when CCTV technicians and maintenance staff detected serious water leakage at the top levels of the Ministry of Finance building, leading to interception and detention of the individual.</p>
<p>When searched, a gauge and valve taken from a pump line were found on his person, together with other items of a suspicious nature, he said.</p>
<p>'The individual was subsequently charged by the police with malicious damage and remanded into custody,' said Imbert.</p>
<p>The minister said that an assessment conducted by the technical staff of the ministry and its specialist contractors revealed significant risks due the actions of this individual.</p>
<p>Had the individual not been caught, and the effects of his actions not detected early enough, Imbert said the result would have included: -Water tanks running dry, resulting in a building shutdown.</p>
<p>-The chillers for the air-conditioning system at the Ministry of Finance malfunctioning, again leading to a building shutdown.</p>
<p>-Water pouring into the electrical systems at the Ministry of Finance, again leading to a building shutdown.</p>
<p>-General chaos and confusion and evacuation of the Ministry of Finance, during which other unauthorised individuals could have engaged in malicious acts.</p>
<p>-Damage and destruction of important documents and records at the ministry.</p>
<p>According to Imbert, the Finance Ministry is now taking further precautions to protect its infrastructure, and, by extension, its important documents.</p>
<p>He said 'Thankfully, because of the robust CCTV and security systems in place at the ministry, the individual was apprehended, and the damage contained.'</p>
<p>The Express sent questions to Police Commissioner Erla Christopher for information on who was the person charged and other details.</p>
<p>However, there was no immediate response to questions sent.</p>
<p>The TTPS has not issued a release on the matter.
