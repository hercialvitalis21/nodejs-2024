Lawyers for Auditor General want investigative team declared 'unlawful'...

Court asked to rule on probe



PORT OF SPAIN

■ Rickie Ramdass

rickie.ramdass@trinidadexpress.com

THE High Court may today decide whether the probe launched into the circumstances surrounding the understatement of revenue in the Auditor General's Report for the financial year 2023 should be stopped.

Yesterday afternoon, a team of attorneys representing Auditor General Jaiwantie Ramdass, headed by former attorney general Anand Ramlogan, SC, filed an application for judicial review.

The High Court is being asked to declare that the investigative team, appointed by acting Prime Minister and Finance Minister Colm Imbert and which is to be headed by retired judge David Harris, is unlawful.

The matter is expected to be heard virtually before Justice Westmin James this afternoon.

Ramdass' attorneys are asking the court to direct that the probe be stopped, on the basis that Imbert has usurped the constitutional role and function of the independent Public Service Commission (PSC) by appointing his own investigation team to enquire into the conduct of public officers in the Ministry of Finance.

The attorneys are contending that this is a breach of Section 121 of the Constitution and an impermissible intrusion into the constitutional remit of the PSC.

In the substantive claim, they are seeking to have the court quash the decision of the minister to advise the Cabinet to appoint the investigative team, a declaration that the investigation of the said matters by the team appointed by the minister is unfair, and illegal; as well as a declaration that Ramdass has been treated unfairly and contrary to the principles of natural justice in breach of Section 20 of the Judicial Review Act Chapter 7:08.

Legal letters

In a pre-action protocol letter issued on Sunday, Ramdass's attorneys stated that Imbert is inextricably intertwined in the scenario and is a main protagonist in the conflict. Therefore, he should have no role to play in appointing an investigative team.

'Having launched such a scathing attack against the Auditor General in both Houses of Parliament, the Minister of Finance has clearly descended into the arena in the present controversy. Indeed, he is a key protagonist who went on the political defensive and launched an unfounded and malicious attack against our client.

'This investigation is therefore nothing more than a not-so-clever attempt by him to distance himself from the very fiasco he created. Make no mistake about it, he is the author of his own political misfortunes in this regard. Far from remaining neutral and impartial, he took a side and sought to defend, explain and justify the action and conduct of his Ministry,' the attorneys stated.

On Wednesday, Imbert, through his attorneys, Jo-Anne Julien, of MG Daly and Partners, who instructs Douglas Mendes, SC, and Simon de la Bastide, who represents the State, responded to Ramdass's attorneys, saying the probe would not be stopped.

They said the investigation was not illegal and was not in contravention of Sections 121 and 136 of the Constitution.

According to the Imbert's attorneys, Section 136 of the Constitution provides for the removal of an Auditor General by the President on the advice of a tribunal.

It added that it was clear from the investigation team's terms of reference that it is not being tasked with investigating the question as to whether Ramdass should be removed from the Office of Auditor General.

'Further, to the extent that the Terms of Reference may require the Investigation Team to investigate the conduct of your client, any findings made by the team in that regard will not be binding on the President of the Republic or any tribunal set up under section 136,' the letter stated.

'To the extent that the Investigation Team makes any findings with respect to the conduct of the Auditor General the most that might be done is that such findings might be passed on by the Prime Minister to the President for consideration in deciding whether the question of removing the Auditor General should be investigated,' Imbert's lawyers stated.

'SCATHING ATTACK': Jaiwantie Ramdass

Imbert: Issue of Auditor General's removal doesn't come into play

Investigation to determine what happened, says Finance Minister



PORT OF SPAIN

■ Ria Taitt

ACTING Prime Minister and Finance Minister Colm Imbert does not see why anybody would be intimidated by the probe into the imbroglio involving the Auditor General and the Ministry of Finance.

Speaking at yesterday's post-Cabinet news conference at Whitehall, Port of Spain, Imbert said the Government-commissioned investigation had nothing to do with the Auditor General's removal.

Attorneys for Auditor General Jaiwantie Ramdass have contended that the investigation is unconstitutional and illegal because the Cabinet and the minister do not have the constitutional jurisdiction to investigate the action and conduct of the Auditor General outside of the confines of Section 136, which deals with the establishment of a tribunal to look into the question of the Auditor General's removal.

'We are saying that the contention that Section 136 of the Constitution comes into play with respect to the Ministry of Finance investigation is wrong because it does not. Section 136 speaks to the removal of the Auditor General, and that is done by way of the establishment of a tribunal by the President, in accordance with prescribed procedures.

'Our investigation cannot and does not even contemplate the idea of invoking Section 136 of the Constitution. Our investigation is just to determine what happened,' Imbert stated.

Imbert took issue with the reporting in yesterday's newspapers on the two letters prepared by the Ministry of Finance's attorneys, one of which dealt with the whole question of the claim of illegality and unconstitutionality of the investigation and the other letter responding to the Auditor General on the issue of the Report of the Auditor General on the Public Accounts for the financial year 2023.

Imbert said the headline on Page 3 of yesterday's Express, 'Imbert drops legal action against 'premature' report', was inaccurate because there was never any legal action against any 'premature' report, so there is no legal action to drop. It was never contemplated in the first place. What our lawyers said in the pre-action letter was that we do not intend to pursue legal action at this time. The words are very, very, very clear,' he said.

Imbert said that the Minister of Finance's lawyers said that based on a 2018 Privy Council ruling-in a matter involving the Chief Justice versus the Law Association, in which the Chief Justice brought judicial proceedings against the Law Association, challenging its power to enquire into certain allegations made against him-the Privy Council made it clear that an investigation can take place, but the investigation is not binding on the persons involved.

'It does not lead to disciplinary action. It does not lead to removal from office or anything like that. It is simply an investigation,' he said.

Imbert said the investigation cannot be binding on anyone, 'cannot be binding on any of the public servants involved or the Auditor General herself. It is simply a fact-finding mission. Once the facts have been established, then other things can be done. But the investigation itself is just to determine the facts,' he added.

A wake-up call

Imbert said the error-involving the $2.6 billion understatement of revenue which occurred because a new system was implemented in February 2023 where everything was done electronically-was a 'wake-up call'.

He said one of the main purposes of the investigation was to determine whether when the electronic cheque clearing system came in, there were errors and whether there were double postings of enormous sums of money which was not communicated properly to the Board of Inland Revenue which never received the corrections.

'We have to find out whether the new cheque clearing system is working properly. Is it effective? Is it fit for purpose? Should it be continued with, should they revert to the manual system? (Because) we don't want this to happen again. So that is object number one,' he said.

He said 'object number two' of the enquiry is the efforts made by the public servants in the various divisions-the Treasury, Inland Revenue, etc, to deal with the error which was subsequently discovered.

'So the next part of the investigation is when was that discovered? How was it discovered? Who discovered it? And then what happened after,' he added.

He said the third part of the investigation is the issue of presenting the corrections to the Auditor General.

'And that is where the allegations then come in. They (the public servants) tried and they were not allowed to present the information,' Imbert said.

'I don't see somebody being intimidated.... Are we not to find out what happened so we could never correct this and it happens next year again? No way,' he said.

'This is a brand new system so it needs examination, which is what we are looking at right now. We are looking to see who built this system. There are all sorts of questions you want to ask.

'Was it done in-house? Is it a proprietary system? Is it off the shelf? Did consultants do it? Is it something that is used in other countries? We need to find that out,' he said.

<h2>Court to deliver ruling on June 3</h2>
■ Rickie Ramdass

rickie.ramdass@trinidadexpress.com

THE High Court will deliver on June 3 its ruling on whether it will be granting permission to Auditor General Jaiwantie Ramdass to file judicial review proceedings against the Ministry of Finance and the Cabinet over the decision to appoint an investigation team to probe the circumstances surrounding the $2.6 billion understatement in her 2023 financial report.

Justice Westmin James gave the date yesterday during a preliminary hearing of a legal challenge against the probe brought by Ramdass.

On Thursday afternoon, her attorneys, led by former attorney general Anand Ramlogan, SC, filed the judicial review application, contending that the appointment of the investigative team by Finance Minister and acting Prime Minister Colm Imbert was unlawful.

Appointed to head the investigation is retired High Court judge David Harris.

Justice James has two issues to consider.

The first issue is whether Ramdass should be granted leave to pursue her judicial review claim, and if so, whether the court ought to grant interim relief stopping the investigation, pending the outcome of the substantive claim.

During yesterday's virtual hearing, the judge said that he first had to consider the issue of leave. If this is not granted, then the interim relief being sought will fall by the wayside. While this was so, the judge said he was willing to consider both issues together.

But Ramlogan objected, submitting that in his view, the court should first focus its mind on the issue of leave.

'Let us clear the first and preliminary hurdle. If leave is not granted, then that is the end of the matter,' said Ramlogan.

In making the submission, he said his client was seeking to limit her legal costs. If her team of attorneys were directed to file written submissions on both issues and were to have the leave application shot down, Ramlogan said this would result in Ramdass having to bear unnecessary legal costs.

Low threshold

In response to Ramlogan's submissions, Douglas Mendes, SC, who is leading the case for the Finance Minister and the Cabinet, said in his view, the case did not even meet the threshold for leave being granted.

But even if 'the low threshold is met' Mendes said the interim relief being sought should not be granted.

In the end, Justice James agreed that the feasible option was to have the attorneys file written submissions only in respect of the leave application.

If Ramdass were to succeed, it will be only then that the parties will be made to file submissions regarding the application to stop the investigation.

Ramlogan stated that he would be able to file his submissions by today, however, the judge granted him and his junior attorneys until Monday to do so.

Mendes was given until next Wednesday to file on behalf his clients, and Ramlogan was granted until next Friday to file any replies should he find it necessary.

Should the deadlines be complied with, Justice James said he will deliver his ruling on the leave application by June 3.

AG's Office denied admission At the start of the proceedings, Russell Martineau, SC, made an application seeking to have the Office of the Attorney General joined in the matter as an interested party.

This position was also resisted by Ramlogan, who questioned the purpose of the AG's Office being joined.

He pointed out that Ramdass had filed the proceedings against the Ministry of Finance and the Cabinet.

'The Attorney General is a member of the Cabinet,' said Ramlogan, adding that the Attorney General was also the legal adviser to the Cabinet.

He suggested that the AG's Office wanted to join the Cabinet and the Minister of Finance in order to 'play tag-team', with each of them mounting the same arguments. This, he said, was a tactical move to have Ramdass bear more legal costs in the instance that she failed.

'If the Attorney General is coming, by some legal miracle, to say that he is objecting to the Cabinet, then that is a different story,' said Ramlogan.

He said if the Office of the Attorney General was allowed to become a party, then Ramdass' legal team would be required to file two separate sets of submissions to which Martineau and Mendes would be mounting the same arguments.

Questioned by the judge on what the position of the Attorney General was, Martineau admitted this his client did not believe that leave or the interim relief being sought by Ramdass should be granted.

Justice James eventually ruled that at this stage of the proceedings, he was not willing to allow the AG's Office to become a party in the matter.

And if he were to eventually rule that Ramdass should be granted leave to pursue her judicial review claim, then the position would be reconsidered.

'The court does not need to hear from the Attorney General in relation to leave,' said the judge.

Appearing along with Mendes for the Ministry of Finance and the Cabinet are attorneys Simon de la Bastide, SC, Jo-Anne Julien and Sashi Indarsingh, while Vanessa Gopaul and Kendra Mark-Gordon will be appearing with Martineau should the Office of the Attorney General be made an interested party.

Background

Ramlogan, along with attorneys Kent Samlal, Jodie Blackstock, Natasha Bisram and Aasha Ramlal, filed the applications on behalf of Ramdass on Thursday, four days after Imbert said there would be no cancellation of the investigation.

His statement came after Ramdass' legal team issued a pre-action protocol letter on May 12 that the probe be stopped or legal action would be filed.

In the applications, it was stated that the investigation carried the risk of interfering with the independence of the Office of the Auditor General.

Ramdass is seeking several declarations relating to the appointment of the investigative team and wants to have the decision quashed.

In addition, she is seeking an injunction restraining the Harris team from investigating anything related to the audit of the 2023 public accounts.

Ongoing probe into SSA...
Suspended director arrested


■ Mark Bassant

Senior Multimedia Investigative Journalist/Producer

SUSPENDED director of the Strategic Services Agency (SSA) Major Roger Best and Pastor Ian Brown were among six people held by police from Wednesday night into yesterday morning as the police investigation into the intelligence gathering unit continued.

Intelligence sources informed the Express that the operation, which involved both the northern and eastern police divisions, included personnel from the Professional Standards Bureau (PSB), the Special Branch and other units.

Best was held at the home of a former senior SSA employee in a gated community in Arima, an intelligence source confirmed yesterday.

Additionally, officers also searched the home of a senior SSA employee at another gated community in Arima.

Another law enforcement source said Brown was picked up by PSB officers from a residence in the eastern division and brought to the Besson Street Police Station, Port of Spain, where he is being held pending further investigations.

Four other ex-SSA workers were also apprehended and taken to different police stations in the northern and eastern divisions, where they were expected to be questioned about several issues in the ongoing SSA investigation.

Four high-powered weapons which Pastor Brown returned to the SSA armoury in Cumuto on March 15, which was exclusively reported by the Express on March 25, is one of the issues that police are expected to question Best about.

On March 15, SSA personnel audited and evaluated the facility; the following day, Pastor Brown signed in the weapons (two submachine guns and two assault weapons) to the SSA armoury.

Investigators have been trying to determine the period Brown had the weapons and who gave instructions to issue them.

Brown, the head of the Jerusalem Bride Church and the Eden Restored Church, and several other church members had been hired by Best who has since been sent on administrative leave.

In addition to the SSA enquiry, homicide detectives are also looking into the October 2019 shootings of Bryan Felix and Aleem Khan as well as the November 11, 2023 shooting death of contractor Andy Daniel along the Uriah Butler Highway.

There are allegations that three men may have been killed by a hit squad which operated within the SSA.

On March 2, Best was placed on administrative leave following the hiring of certain members of the Jerusalem Bride Church led by Brown.

Best was later replaced by Brigadier Anthony Phillips-Spencer, who is currently engaged in a review and audit of all SSA personnel, equipment and processes.

The Express reached out to Police Commissioner Erla Christopher via WhatsApp about the exercise and the detention of Best yesterday but there was no immediate response.

Imbert: Better performance expected of Erla in 2nd term



■ Kim Boodram

ACTING Prime Minister Colm Imbert said yesterday a better performance is expected from Police Commissioner Erla Christopher in her second term.

Speaking at the post-Cabinet news conference at Whitehall, Port of Spain, Imbert said the Cabinet had to support Christopher and noted that she 'got a good rating'.

He noted that Christopher has 'only had one year in the job', adding: 'She was not a Commissioner of Police before, there would be a learning curve as well.'

Cabinet has approved a one-year extension for Christopher as the country's top cop.

Imbert said Cabinet had to support the Commissioner, noting that the process of recruiting candidates for the position was a lengthy one.

'I would think that as a Cabinet, we had to support the Commissioner of Police,' he said. 'We had to support her. Because she got a good rating and we had to support the police.'

Asked whether the Cabinet had any opinion on Christopher's extension, Imbert replied, 'No.'

Imbert said the Police Service Commission (PolSC) began its recruitment process in April 2024.

He said the Cabinet 'looked at all the options available and the process to appoint a Commissioner of Police is a long one'.

He said the PolSC 'only started its exercise to recruit a new Commissioner of Police in April'.

Imbert said the PolSC had 'rated her good', referring to the CoP.

'All the other complications that would arise, if you did not extend, you don't know what would happen next. You don't know who would be recommended to act as CoP. And you would not get a recommendation for a permanent appointment for another six to nine months,' he said. 'So we, as a group of decision-makers, we are faced with this, that the recruitment exercise for a Commissioner of Police will not be completed before the end of this year and therefore someone would have to be put to act.'

He asked: 'Who is going to be put to act?'

Imbert said the practice of the Trinidad and Tobago Police Service (TTPS) was to 'appoint a deputy'.

'We have three new deputies of Commissioner of Police, only approved a few months ago. They are untested and untried,' he noted, adding: 'We felt in all the circumstances, the best thing to do was to extend.'

'On what basis were we going to say we reject the scientific assessment by the Police Service Commission of the CoP's performance? Are we going to go on feeling?' Imbert asked.

He said Christopher had the support of the 'vast majority' of the Police Service.

'So, thousands of police officers, through their association, the vast majority of officers, have come out in full support of the extension of the sitting Commissioner of Police,' he said. 'That's a very positive sign. They are ready and willing to work with her.'

Imbert said Christopher had received support from the business community as well. In response to a question Imbert said the matter of Christopher's vacation leave has not yet been brought up.

He said this would have created a 'conundrum', as the Parliament would have to debate on her replacement and the issue was yet to be discussed by the Cabinet.

'You don't know who would be recommended to act as CoP. And you would not get a recommendation for a permanent appointment for another six to nine months.'

GOOD RATING: Police Commissioner Erla Christopher.
