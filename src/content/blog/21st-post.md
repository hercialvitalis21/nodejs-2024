<h2>T&TEC confirms meter upgrades</h2>

THE Trinidad and Tobago Electricity Commission (T& TEC) has confirmed that it is currently engaged in conducting meter upgrade exercises.

T& TEC sent out a news release yesterday after numerous complaints from customers of men claiming to be T& TEC employees engaged in an upgrade exercise. However, T& TEC noted in its release that it is conducting meter upgrade exercises.

'As such, its authorised contractors are required to access the premises of affected customers to conduct this work. This exercise is ongoing and will continue periodically, on Fridays and Saturdays, as the Commission conducts necessary maintenance,' it added.

The release noted: 'Customers are also reminded that the Commission engages in weekly disconnections for the non-payment of arrears, which may also utilise contractors' services. Members of the public are therefore urged to call T& TEC Estate Police's official hotline numbers to verify the identity of anyone claiming to be a T& TEC employee/contractor.'

It also said that employees of T& TEC are required to display their commission-issued identification and/ or present it on request. T& TEC listed its contact information for persons seeking clarification about its employees who turn up at their gates.
