PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad (CMC) — Organisers of the ICC Men’s Twenty20 World Cup in the Caribbean and the United States said they are on alert and national security agencies are taking all the necessary steps to ensure the event comes off without a hitch.

This issue surfaced following the circulation of a document on social media last week in Barbados that the Caricom Implementation Agency for Crime and Security had received information of a potential security threat to the tournament from the Pro-Islamic State.

Trinidad & Tobago Prime Minister Dr Keith Rowley, head of national security for the two-island republic and chairman of the Caricom Prime Ministerial Sub-Committee on Cricket, said the regional and international security apparatus is working to combat any security threat that could potentially disrupt the tournament.

“Given the fact that bad actors can choose to misbehave in any way possible it makes it virtually impossible to completely seal off all opportunities,” he told the Trinidad Express newspaper on Sunday.

Cricket West Indies and the International Cricket Council (ICC), the sport’s global organising body, said in a joint statement that “robust security plans” have been put in place for the tournament which will be contested from June 1 to 29.

“We work closely with authorities in the host countries and cities, and continually monitor and evaluate the global landscape to ensure appropriate plans are in place to mitigate any risks identified to our event,” the statement said.

“We want to assure all stakeholders that safety and security of everyone at the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup is our number one priority, and we have a comprehensive and robust security plan in place.”

The World Cup will be staged at venues in the Caribbean territories of Antigua, Barbados, Guyana, St Lucia, St Vincent, and Trinidad, and in the American states of Florida, New York, and Texas.

It will be contested by 20 teams, including West Indies, co-hosts and two-time champions, and the United States.

England are the defending champions.

<h2>Ambrose backs West Indies to win T20 title</h2>
NEW YORK, United States (CMC) — Iconic fast bowler Sir Curtly Ambrose says West Indies have enough firepower to win an unprecedented third ICC Men’s Twenty20 World Cup when they co-host the tournament next month with the United States.

The former West Indies fast bowler said recent results against powerhouses South Africa, India, and England under the captaincy of Rovman Powell have raised his optimism about the team’s chance of success.

“We have a very, very good team,” he said during the launch of the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium earlier this week in the United States.

“As we speak, they [West Indies] are in Antigua at a camp preparing themselves for the start of the T20 World Cup which is a couple of weeks away. I believe once the guys start playing consistent cricket and smart cricket, I believe we can take the trophy.”

West Indies are one of the two sides that have won the title twice (England are the other), and they will need to overturn poor form at recent ICC tournaments to fulfil the prediction made by Ambrose.

They did not make it out of the first round of the past two T20I World Cups — in 2021 in Oman and the United Arab Emirates and two years ago in Australia — and failed to qualify for last year’s ICC Men’s One-day International Cricket World Cup in India.

“It’s not going to be easy, but we are one of only two nations to have won it twice, so we are going to try and make it three,” Ambrose added.

“And no other nation has ever won it on home soil, so all that is motivation for the guys to do well, and I am hoping they can do it.”

West Indies are part of Group C in the World Cup and face Papua New Guinea, Uganda, New Zealand, and Afghanistan.

Ambrose said he expects that there could be a few upsets during the tournament — he hopes none involve West Indies — because every side has plenty of talented players at their disposal.

“I admire a lot of cricketers [at the T20I World Cup], and I am looking forward to them doing well,” he said. “As a proud Antiguan and being from the West Indies, I want the West Indies to win.

“It’s not going to be easy because in T20 cricket every team has an equal chance of beating any other team and that is just the nature of T20 cricket. It’s going to be exciting, but I am going to be rooting for West Indies.”

T20 W’Cup officials confident of ‘world-class’ New York venue
NEW YORK, United States (CMC) — Officials of the International Cricket Council (ICC) and organisers of the ICC Men’s Twenty20 World Cup matches in the United States said they were confident that the drop-in turf pitches installed at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium will play up to mark.

Four drop-in turf pitches are now in place at the 34,000-seat temporary stadium in Eisenhower Park in Nassau County, east of Manhattan, that is set to host eight World Cup matches, including a spicy contest between political and sporting rivals, India and Pakistan, on June 9.

Chris Tetley, head of events at the ICC, hailed the work that has taken place to erect the facility, which includes a full-sized outfield with dimensions of 75 yards east and west, and 67 yards north and south.

“We are around about as big as The Gabba [in Australia], or The Oval [in England], or Wankhede Stadium [in India] in terms of playing area,” he said.

The site of the stadium will be restored to a municipally accessible park when the tournament ends, but Tetley said the legacy benefit will be a “world-class international playing facility with drainage and irrigation” for the cricket-playing community in the area.

Six other drop-in turf pitches have also been installed in nearby practice facilities.

Adelaide Oval pitch curator Damian Hough was given the responsibility of developing the pitches for the facility in Australia and transporting them to the venue via the American state of Florida.

“Two and a half weeks out from the first game, we’re very happy and have nothing to worry about,” said Hough.

A handful of the sport’s icons, including former West Indies fast bowler Sir Curtly Ambrose, and a galaxy of New York sports stars joined retired Jamaican sprint sensation Usain Bolt for first look at the venue on Wednesday.

Joining Bolt in the special preview were World Cup-bound United States Captain Monank Patel and his teammate Corey Anderson, the former New Zealand all-rounder, former Pakistan Captain Shoaib Malik and former England pacer Liam Plunkett.

Also present were former New York Knicks basketballer John Starks, former New York Giants wide receiver Victor Cruz, and former Major League Baseball pitcher Bartolo “Big Sexy” Colón.

The World Cup matches in the United States are also to be played in the cities of Dallas in the state of Texas, and Lauderhill in Florida.

The United States are co-hosts with the Caribbean for the global showpiece, which opens on June 1 and ends with the final on June 29 in Barbados.
<h3>WHAT A MISS!

WHAT A MISS!
T20 World Cup Ambassador Bolt wanted Sabina Park as one of the tournament venues
ALTHOUGH looking forward to the ICC Twenty20 World Cup, Jamaica’s legendary sprint star Usain Bolt says it is “disappointing” the island won’t be hosting any games next month.

The eight-time Olympic champion is an ambassador of the June 1-29 tournament which will be held in the Caribbean and the United States. Bolt joined compatriots two-time World Cup winner Chris Gayle as well as music icon Sean Paul, who recorded the official song for the tournament.

Jamaica will also have contributions on the pitch through West Indies Captain Rovman Powell, along with star all-rounder Andre Russell and batsman Brandon King.

However, Jamaicans will have to travel across the region if they are to see their countrymen as matches will be held in Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Barbados, Antigua and Barbuda, St Lucia, and St Vincent and the Grenadines. Most will also require an American visa to attend matches in New York, Florida and Texas.

The Jamaican Government turned down the opportunity to bid to host matches at Sabina Park, with Sport Minister Olivia “Babsy” Grange saying it wasn’t worth it financially after a “robust cost-benefit analysis”.

“As a responsible minister I am obliged to look beyond immediate gratification to sustainable sport development that will yield immeasurable rewards at all levels in Jamaica. I had to pay attention to the cost-benefit analysis, especially in a circumstance of limited resources,” she said last September.

However, speaking with the Jamaica Observer days ago, Bolt believes the Jamaican atmosphere would have added another element to the World Cup.

“It’s always disappointing because I think when you go to Sabina Park it’s always wonderful, and Red Stripe always [had] that mound that’s always exciting. It’s disappointing but it’s just one of those things,” he said.

“We can’t focus on that; we just have to go out there and support our West Indian team. Wherever they are, we can try to go see a game and try to cheer them on.”

The West Indies are one of the most successful teams in the shortest format, with World Cup wins in 2012 and 2016, England being the only other country to have won the title more than once.

Despite being a host nation and multiple winners, the sixth-ranked Caribbean men might not be as feared by some opponents as they have been in the past. Their last two appearances at the tournament were well below expectations. In 2021 they registered just one win from their five matches in the Super 12 round, then in 2022 they failed to make it out of the group which featured relative minnows Zimbabwe, Ireland and Scotland.

But Bolt, who will be attending matches across the region, is confident they can make a splash this time around.

“I feel like when it comes to the T20 and One-Day [Internationals] I think we as a team we do extremely well, so we’re all very high. We’ve won it already, and I think we can do it again if we just continue on the same path and we show up when it matters,” he said.

The West Indies are in Group C with 2021 finalists New Zealand, Afghanistan, Uganda and Papua New Guinea, with only two advancing to the knockout round.

Those games will be played at Providence Stadium in Guyana, Brian Lara Cricket Academy in Trinidad, and Daren Sammy National Cricket Stadium in St Lucia.

<h3>Rovman to adopt Royals strategies for World Cup campaign</h3>

Rovman to adopt Royals strategies for World Cup campaign

DELHI, India (CMC) — West Indies Twenty20 captain Rovman Powell says he will try to borrow the detailed planning involved in the Rajasthan Royals set-up, when he leads his side into next month’s T20 World Cup.

Powell is part of the Royals outfit which have been one of the standout teams in the Indian Premier League this season, currently lying second on 16 points only by virtue of an inferior run rate to leaders Kolkata Knight Riders.

The 30-year-old said one of the hallmarks of the Royals season was the level of planning being undertaken behind the scenes.

“One thing I like with this team is the way how they plan. I think we as West Indians can plan like that,” Powell said Tuesday, following Royals’ defeat to Delhi Capitals.

“They go into specifics, they go into detail, and I think that has accounted for the overall success of the team.

“And it is something I’m looking to take forward from a personal standpoint and see how best I can rub it off to my fellow West Indians.”

Powell will lead West Indies into the June 1-29 tournament which will see the joint hosts taking on Afghanistan, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and Uganda in Group C of the opening round.

The Jamaican, who has enjoyed success since being appointed captain 18 months ago, will also be a key member of his side’s batting group.

However, his opportunities in the IPL have been limited, with only four innings from which he has gathered only 77 runs.

His fortunes have been in contrast to that of the franchise, and Powell said another feature of their success had been the communication at all levels of the playing group.

“I think it’s been the communication between the captain, the coach and the players — communication goes a far way,” Powell explained.

“Communication brings clarity throughout the group and I think that has been a driving force in our success so far.”
