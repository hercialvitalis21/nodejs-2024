<h2>Massy: Florida warehouse will enhance distribution efficiency</h2>
<p>WITH its recently opened warehouse in Florida, United States, Massy Holdings is poised to enhance its distribution efficiency, the conglomerate's senior vice-president of Integrated Retail Portfolio, Ambikah Mongroo has said.

Massy Distribution USA (MDUSA) purchased the 172,136 square-foot warehouse in October last year for US$24.5 million.

'The Jacksonville Warehouse – on Yeager Road in North Jacksonville – is 15 minutes from the Jacksonville Port, while a CSX rail line is located just behind the facility. CSX is a leading supplier of rail-based freight transportation in North America,' a release from Massy stated.

Commenting on the grand opening of the warehouse on April 9, Mongroo stated that the modern facility 'will allow the Distribution Business to benefit from reduced transportation costs (inbound and outbound) and lead times, thereby enabling faster and more cost-effective delivery to our customers in the 23 Caribbean territories that we service'.

Mongroo added that the Jacksonville location, which also features a Free Trade Zone, 'further enhances our ability to be that one solution, serving the fragmented Caribbean market.'

Mongroo also expressed how 'proud' the Group was that the facility had been designed and set up by its in-house warehousing expert, Lloyd Bynoe, from Trinidad, 'who was supported by a Team of Massy professionals'.

'Massy Distribution's clients range from supermarkets, groceries, pharmacies and hospitals to variety stores, wholesalers, hardware stores, agricultural shops and industries, as well as hotels, restaurants and duty-free outlets across the major markets of the English-speaking Caribbean,' the release stated.

MDUSA markets brands such as Silk, Biore, Purina, Duracell, Kraft Heinz, Stella, Lipton, General Mills, P& G, Swiss Miss, Act II, Duncan Hines, Ocean Spray, Valrico and Jergens.

Massy Group's president and CEO David Affonso said 'this momentous milestone in the company's journey of expansion and growth ensures Massy will more efficiently navigate the competitive market that is distribution, particularly in terms of fresh foods, which have a shorter shelf life than other goods.

'This includes distribution of items to Massy's seven Jacksonville Rowe's IGA Supermarkets, which the Group purchased in December 2022 for US$47 million. Under its distribution arm, Massy Distribution has also added new lines in every territory and opened new warehousing space in Barbados and Guyana to support its planned growth,' it stated. 'In his opening speech, vice-president of MDUSA, Ryan Fields, highlighted the opportunities this new facility will bring, including the space to expand our operations, the introduction of stateof the art technology to improve our service levels to our customers and increased efficiency in warehousing. As the company looks ahead, it remains committed to delivering exceptional service, driving innovation, and creating value for its customers, partners, and communities,' the release added.
