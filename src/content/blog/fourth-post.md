Cabinet extended the contract of Police Commissioner (CoP) Erla Harewood-Christopher for several reasons, including a “good” performance review from the Police Service Commission (PolSC) plus an expected lack of support by the Opposition in Parliament for a new nominee, which would have left T&T without a CoP. So said National Security Minister Fitzgerald Hinds yesterday after Monday’s announcement by the Cabinet to extend Harewood-Christopher’s contract by one year.

Hinds, asked by Guardian Media during a telephone interview to give Cabinet’s reasons for extending the contract, said there were several reasons grounding the decision. He also elaborated on the extension of the CoP to the media at a function at the Maximum Security Prison in Arouca late yesterday.

Regarding Harewood-Christopher’s extension, Hinds said there “were a couple of serious and imposing considerations.”

These include the law, the Constitution, and Section 75 of the Police Act, which permits the extension of an officer.

“Section 75 was the provision that our granting Madame Erla Harewood-Christopher the extension for the past year was challenged in the court.

“In addition to that, you will recall that Madame Christopher’s birthday is May 14 ... today (Tuesday), and had we gone past midnight last night by even a scintilla of time, her appointment as commissioner by the Police Service Commission, which the court upheld as the only body enabled to do so under the Constitution, would have expired, and we would have immediately reverted to the unwelcome circumstance of having a police service without a substantive officer holder as commissioner leader.”

He said that would have been an “undesirable” position for the country.

Hinds said the court had to interpret Section 75 of the act against the Constitution.

“In the first instance, Justice Rahim and the Court of Appeal found that it was quite proper, nothing irregular ... not unconstitutional, but in keeping with what the law expected.”

The Government, he said, is always guided by the law.

He said that two judgments by the court had made it quite clear that the CoP was already appointed by the PolSC and the extension was merely that. An extension of the appointment ...” he added.

Noting that Harewood-Christopher was appointed for a year, he indicated that if the period had been allowed to expire, “We’d have gone back to the undesirable condition of not having a Commissioner of Police in the post—something this Government has worked hard to avert since 2015.”

‘We acted in the widest, deepest, and healthiest public interest’

Having attained age 60, Hinds said, “Section 15 allows for an extension of her service by the PolSC.”

 Hinds said had they allowed the term of the extension to expire, the Opposition would have made a “hue and a cry and a stand about an appointment that would have had to go back to the Parliament.”

“We wanted to ensure the T&T Police Service was set with the leadership of a commissioner for all times so her tenure would have assured that.”

As soon as the PNM Government took office in 2015, they triggered the process of writing the PolSC to say that they should engage in the process of recruiting a substantive CoP.

That decision was challenged in court.

He said the court decided that the PolSC was the only body that should have triggered such a process and amended the order.

Hinds also cited the Opposition’s modus operandi of refusing to support Government undertakings in Parliament. He noted the UNC’s refusal to support the recent Constitutional Amendment Bill seeking to give the PolSC authority to approve acting appointments of a senior officer, rather than coming to Parliament to do this every time a CoP is absent for vacation, illness, family or bereavement purposes.

“They (UNC) refused to support the bill! Point blank! So given that recalcitrant posture, we knew that had we allowed her term to expire, a new appointment would have had to be made via the Parliament and we could anticipate no support from the Opposition,” Hinds added.

Hind said that on April 12, 2024, the PolSC put out an advertisement inviting applications for the position of CoP.

Based on experience and common sense, Hinds said, they knew that the process for a new CoP would have probably taken beyond six months.

He said the Government did not want to return to the untenable position of a Police Service with no commissioner.

“We eventually got one with a failed experiment, and then we got Mr Jacob, who served.”

Hinds said the law states “that you have to review the commissioner’s extension ... it is for a maximum of three years.”

But it is reviewable every year.

‘We reached out to the PolSC ‘

Having followed the law, Hinds said they reached out to the PolSC, which had the mandate and responsibility to “access her work during the period of the year ... that she served in the extension, and they responded to us.”

The PolSC was asked if they had done a review of her performance.

“And if so, can you help us? What is your finding? They came back telling us, having looked at a number of different criteria, they came back telling us that her overall rating was good. So we knew that the Police Service Commission, which appointed her, and we extended, and now want to consider a further extension.”

Hinds said, having assessed her performance in the last year, they found “that it was good.”

With that in mind, Hinds said, “We were more emboldened to act in accordance with the law and public interest. So it was a combination of those factors. But when we looked at their assessment of good, we realised that they would have reached out to several stakeholders, not the least the remainder of the executive, the leadership, or a sample thereof of the Police Service, from which a favourable rating came.”

Hinds noted that other stakeholders would have weighed in. He said the Police Social and Welfare Association was also in support of her extension.

He added, “The commission would also have taken into account crime statistics, which showed a reduction in some aspects of crime, including murders.”

According to the National Security Minister, the Cabinet’s consideration also included the fact that on April 12, the commission opened the process for applicants for the post of Police Commissioner.

“And that is ongoing. From our experience, it will take some time to make a nomination to the President for our consideration. So in the meantime, it was appropriate to have a substantive Commissioner of Police in office, and for that reason, we extended Mrs Harewood-Christopher’s contract,” he added.

“We know now that the stakeholders who they consulted found satisfaction. We also know that not every member of the public is so minded.”

He said we live in a democratic country and opinions would vary.

“But we, the Government, on the basis of those facts, guided by the law, tells confident that we acted in the widest, deepest, and healthiest public interest.”

Hinds said all he can do is provide support and resources to the CoP and officers to protect the population and make T&T safe.

Hinds wished Harewood-Christopher and her officers well, fortitude, and safety “because we are indeed in a very crisis time with crime in the region. Not just Trinidad.”

He promised the Government would do all within its powers to stem the flow of illegal guns entering our shores.

“All things considered, we think we arrived at the right conclusion, and we pray for a better future.”

Asked if the PolSC submitted nominees for the post of CoP to the President who in turn would forward it to Parliament, how it would be treated, Hinds said, “That is going to be a very relevant factor ... a powerful new intervening fact.”

He said the Government would be obliged to consider it “going forward.”

“For me, today to say what the Cabinet will do then, I am not the Cabinet; I am just a part.”

Hinds opted not to rate Harewood-Christopher’s performance when asked.
